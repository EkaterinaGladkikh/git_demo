sleep my joy, sleep
the lights went out in the house
the fish fell asleep in the pond
the birds fell asleep in the garden

The mouse is sleeping behind the stove
The moon looks out the window
Close your eyes rather
Sleep, my joy, sleep

In the morning you will again
run, laugh, play
Tomorrow I'll be in the garden for you
I will find many flowers
